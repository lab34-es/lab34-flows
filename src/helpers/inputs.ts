/**
 * Asking the person running a flow for a value, from wherever they are
 * running it.
 *
 * A step may need something only a human can supply -- the barcode of the
 * parcel actually in their hand, a code shown on a locker screen. Reading it
 * straight from `process.stdin`, which is what applications used to do, only
 * works on the CLI: started from the UI the prompt is printed on the terminal
 * the server happens to be attached to (nobody is looking at it) and the run
 * hangs for good.
 *
 * So the request is routed through the reporter, exactly like every other
 * thing a run has to say:
 *
 *  - on the CLI the reporter reads the answer from stdin, as before;
 *  - from the UI it emits the request over the socket and the answer comes
 *    back through `POST /api/flows/input`, which lands in `answer()` here.
 *
 * Requests wait forever by design -- the person may well walk to the locker
 * before typing. `cancel()` is how a run gets out of one: the UI offers it as
 * a button, and the runner calls `cancelAll()` when a flow ends so nothing is
 * left waiting on a run that is over.
