Its name is always on screen, at the left of the top bar, with the full path in

### Git

A context folder is usually a git repository shared with your team, so the tool
treats it as one.

- The **branch** is shown next to the folder name, with arrows counting the
  commits you have to pull (↓) and to push (↑).
- **Changed files are coloured** in the sidebar, with a letter at the end of the
  row: *M* modified, *U* untracked, *A* added, *D* deleted, *R* renamed. A
  folder takes the colour of whatever changed inside it, however deep — so a
  collapsed folder still tells you something moved.
- The **sync button** next to the folder name opens a panel with the branch, the
  list of changed files, a link to the repository online, and the three buttons
  that matter: **Pull** (rebasing your commits on top), **Commit** and **Push**.

Tick the files you want in a commit, or leave everything unticked to commit the
lot. A branch with no upstream gets one on its first push.

If the folder is not a repository, the panel says so: run \`git init\` in it and
your flows travel with the rest of your code.

The **Document** view renders them as a list you can edit in place: click a
value to change it, click a name to rename it, and use **Add property** for a
new one. \`title\` and \`description\` are ordinary properties, but they are
shown above the list — as the document's heading and standfirst — rather than
as two more rows.

Nothing declares a property's type: it is whatever its value is. A number
sorts numerically, \`true\` / \`false\` renders as a checkbox, a list renders as
chips, and an ISO date sorts chronologically. Adding a property asks which kind
of value to start from, and from then on the value itself is the type.

Properties are what folder views filter and sort on — see *Folder views*.

your context directory, in the shape [Obsidian

as \`contains()\`, \`startsWith()\`, \`isEmpty()\`, \`lower()\`, \`join()\` and

A property a flow does not have is \`null\`, and \`null\` never satisfies a
comparison — so a filter is never broken by a flow nobody has annotated yet.

the table instead of taking the view down.

Applications live in the \`applications\` folder of your context directory. Each
one is a **TypeScript** module that exports methods, and each method is what a

    import { applications, httpClient } from '@lab34/flows';
    import type { Context, Parameters } from '@lab34/flows';

    export const search = applications.handler([

Types are there to help you write the code: applications are transpiled when
they run, never type checked, so a type error never stops a flow. A
\`tsconfig.json\` is kept up to date in your context directory — that is what
points your editor at the types of the installed package.

Documentation is read straight from the **JSDoc blocks** of the application's
\`index.ts\` — there is no \`docs.json\`. That documentation is what the UI renders
*and* what the model is given when it writes a flow for you, so the better the
JSDoc, the better the generated flows.

|-|-|
| \`@param {type} name - description\` | An input parameter. \`[name]\` marks it optional, \`[name=value]\` adds a default. |
| \`@returns {status} description\` | The response, with an optional JSON example body. |
| \`@memory {write\\|read} key - description\` | Flow memory the method writes or reads. |
| \`@example\` | An example step, in YAML, ready to paste into a step block. |

A \`README.md\` in the application folder is rendered in the UI as well.

offline), \`httpbin\` and \`jsonplaceholder\`.

    body: `
A flow carries one plain object called the **memory**. It starts empty every
time you press *Run*, any step can write to it, and every later step can read
it. That is how the id created by step 2 ends up in the body of step 5.

### Writing it: the fourth value a method returns

A method returns a tuple — \`[headers, status, body, memory]\`. The first three
describe the response; the **fourth** is what this step contributes to the
memory.

    export const add = applications.handler([
      async (ctx: Context, parameters: Parameters) => {
        const { a, b } = parameters.body;
        const result = a + b;
        //       headers  status  body                            memory
        return [ {},      200,    { operation: 'add', result },   { lastResult: result } ];
      }
    ], 'add');

That fourth value is **optional**: leave it out, as most methods do, and the
step writes nothing. The helpers (\`httpClient\`, \`pgClient\`, \`playwright\`)
return the first three, so a method that wants to remember something builds
the object itself:

    const [headers, status, responseBody] = await httpClient.post(ctx, '/posts', { body });
    const memory = responseBody && responseBody.id ? { lastPostId: responseBody.id } : {};
    return [headers, status, responseBody, memory];

Writing conditionally like that is the normal thing to do — remember the id
only when there was one, so a failed call does not leave a stale value behind
for the steps that follow.

### How the writes add up

When a step returns, what it wrote is **merged** into the flow memory:

| | |
|-|-|
| New keys | Are added. |
| Keys that already existed | Are **overwritten** by the newer step. |
| Keys the step did not mention | Are left untouched. |
| Objects | Are replaced whole — the merge is shallow, not deep. |

So \`memory.lastResult\` always means *the most recent* result, and a step that
returns no memory changes nothing.

### Reading it: \`{{ memory.key }}\`

Anywhere inside a step's \`parameters\`, a Handlebars template reads the memory
as it stands when that step starts:

    \`\`\`step
    application: calculator
    method: multiply
    description: Multiply the previous result by 2, using memory
    parameters:
      body:
        a: "{{ memory.lastResult }}"
        b: 2
    test:
      status: 200
      body:
        result: 84
    \`\`\`

Nested values work the same way — \`{{ memory.user.id }}\`.

### What to watch out for

| | |
|-|-|
| **Earlier steps only** | A step sees what the steps *above* it wrote. A key nothing has written yet resolves to an empty string. |
| **Parameters only** | Only \`parameters\` are templated. \`test\` assertions are **not**, so \`{{ memory.x }}\` in a test is compared literally — write the expected value out, or assert it with a \`$expr\` expression. |
| **Everything arrives as text** | \`a: "{{ memory.lastResult }}"\` passes the string \`"42"\`, not the number \`42\`. Methods that expect numbers should accept numeric strings — the \`calculator\` example does exactly that. |
| **Reach for the leaf** | \`{{ memory.user }}\` renders \`[object Object]\`. Interpolate \`{{ memory.user.id }}\`, or read the object from application code. |
| **Text is HTML-escaped** | \`{{ }}\` turns \`&\` into \`&amp;\` and \`'\` into \`&#x27;\`. Triple braces \`{{{ }}}\` skip the escaping, but a value containing a double quote will break the step. |
| **Retries reuse the values** | Parameters are resolved once, before the first attempt. A \`retry\` re-sends exactly what was sent the first time; it does not re-read the memory. |
| **One run, one memory** | Memory is never shared between flows and does not survive a run. Press *Run* again and it is empty again. |

### Reading it from application code

A method's third argument is the flow, so \`flow.memory\` is the whole object —
useful when the value is not a scalar, or when the decision belongs to the
method rather than to the flow author:

    export const readBack = applications.handler([
      (ctx: Context, parameters: Parameters, flow: Flow) =>
        httpClient.get(ctx, \`/posts/\${flow.memory.lastPostId}\`)
    ], 'readBack');

A validator can do the same declaratively: \`validate.body\` accepts
\`fallbacks\`, which fill a missing field from the memory before the schema is
checked — the flow may pass \`token\`, and when it does not, the one remembered
by an earlier login step is used.

    validate.body({
      type: 'object',
      properties: { token: { type: 'string' } },
      fallbacks: { token: [{ type: 'memory', key: 'authToken' }] }
    })

### Documenting it

Which keys a method writes (or reads) is part of its documentation, through
the \`@memory\` JSDoc tag:

    /**
     * @memory {write} lastResult - The result of the operation.
     * @memory {read} authToken - The token stored by the login step.
     */

The application page lists them per method under *Memory* — that is where to
look when you are writing a flow and need to know what a step leaves behind.

      body:
        error:
          code: DIVISION_BY_ZERO

### JavaScript expressions

For anything beyond equality, prefix the value with \`$expr:\` and write
JavaScript, where \`value\` is the actual value being tested:

    test:
      body:
        count: "$expr: value > 10"
        items: "$expr: Array.isArray(value) && value.length >= 3"
        user:
          age: "$expr: value >= 18 && value <= 65"

| Validation | Expression |
|-|-|
| Greater than | \`$expr: value > 0\` |
| Exact value | \`$expr: value === 2\` |
| In a range | \`$expr: value >= 5 && value <= 10\` |
| String contains | \`$expr: typeof value === 'string' && value.includes('ok')\` |
| Array has items | \`$expr: Array.isArray(value) && value.length > 0\` |
| Property exists | \`$expr: typeof value === 'object' && 'id' in value\` |
| Date after | \`$expr: new Date(value) > new Date('2023-01-01')\` |

Cover the unhappy paths too: asserting that a missing resource returns \`404\`
is what catches the regression that starts answering \`200\`.

### Configure a provider

In **Settings › AI**, pick one of:

| Provider | What you need |
|-|-|
| **Ollama (local)** | A running Ollama and a pulled model (\`ollama pull llama3.1\`). Nothing leaves your machine. |
| **Google Gemini** | An API key from aistudio.google.com. |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | An API key from console.anthropic.com. Defaults to \`claude-opus-5\`. |

Use **Test connection** before generating anything: it does a real round trip
to the provider.

### Create a flow

When creating a flow, turn on **Create using AI** under the file name. The file
is created first — so it exists whatever happens next — and a second dialog
asks what it should test:

> Create a post on jsonplaceholder with a random title, check it comes back
> with a 201, and then fetch a post that does not exist.

What comes back is a Markdown flow built from the applications you actually
have. It is validated before being saved — it has to parse, contain at least
one step, and only use existing applications and methods — and the model gets
one chance to fix its own mistakes before the error reaches you.

### Edit a flow

Open any flow and use the **magic wand** next to the Document/Source toggle:
describe the change ("also cover the unhappy path", "explain each section") and
the document is rewritten. The result lands in the editor as an **unsaved**
change, so you can read it — and reload to throw it away — before saving.

    body: `
A flow maps to an Xray **Test** issue, and every step block to a **step** of
that test. The link is declared in the flow itself, so it travels with the
document:

    ---
    title: Fraud detection
    xray:
      testKey: ABC-1234
    ---

\`testKey\` can also be set inside a step block; that one is informative for now.

Configure it in **Settings › Xray**. Three flavours are supported:

- **Xray Cloud** — data comes from Xray's API, authenticated with an API key
  you create in Jira at *Apps › Xray › API Keys* (client id + client secret).
  Keep the default Xray URL unless your instance uses a regional endpoint
  (\`https://eu.xray.cloud.getxray.app\`, \`https://us.xray.cloud.getxray.app\`).
- **Jira Cloud (API token)** — for when you cannot get an Xray API key (it
  needs Jira admin rights): the data is read from Jira with your **email** and
  an **Atlassian API token**, created at *id.atlassian.com › Security › API
  tokens*. Xray-only data, like the test type, is not available this way.
- **Jira Server / Data Center** — no external service: the data is read from
  Jira with a **personal access token**, created at *your profile › Personal
  Access Tokens*.

**Project keys** is the list of Jira projects a pull downloads, separated by
commas (\`ABC, ACME\`). Each project is pulled into a folder of its own.

**Test connection** validates the credentials for real. Nothing is downloaded
until a flow that mentions a test key is rendered, and every key is downloaded
at most once per run of the tool.

**Pull tests** downloads every Test of those projects into an \`xray\` folder in
your flows — one folder per project key, one Markdown document per test, with
the Jira description and the Xray **test details** as its content, and no step
blocks yet. The details block
is the Test Details panel as Markdown: the steps of a Manual test, the scenario
of a Cucumber one, the definition of a Generic one. Xray Cloud answers them
with the tests themselves; on Server/DC the steps come from Xray's own API;
with a Jira API token only what Xray exposes as a Jira field can be read.

Inside a project's folder, with an Xray API key (Cloud) or on Server/DC the
folders mirror the **Test Repository**; with a Jira API token there is no Test Repository to read, so
they are rebuilt from Jira's hierarchy:

    xray/<PROJECT>/<FEATURE>_<slug>/<STORY>_<slug>/<TEST>_<slug>.md

A test that is a child of nothing gets its feature and story from its
**related work** — the issue links — and whatever cannot be resolved lands in
\`_no-feature\` / \`_no-user-story\`. A project Jira will not answer is logged and
the pull moves on to the next one. Pulling again rewrites only the frontmatter,
the description block and the details block: the steps you wrote stay, a test
that moved in Jira is moved rather than duplicated, and nothing is ever deleted.

**Overwrite tests already pulled** decides what that second pull does with the
tests that are already on disk. On (the default), a flow whose \`xray.testKey\`
is already in \`xray\` is updated with what Jira says now. Off, it is left
exactly as it is — not moved, not rewritten, nothing downloaded for it — and
only tests that were never pulled are written; the modal counts the rest as
**skipped**.

> Uploading executions back to Xray is **not supported yet**: nothing this
> integration does ever writes to Jira.

When Jira cannot be reached, the key is shown as plain text with the error on
hover — a flow never fails to render, or to run, because of Jira.
